        <p>Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls worldwide. They formed the basis for the women's rights movement in the 19th century and the feminist movements during the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
              <p>Ensuring womenâ€™s rights requires a  understanding of the social structures and power relations that frame not only laws and politics but also the economy, social dynamics and family and community life.
